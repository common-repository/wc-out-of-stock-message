== # 🏆 Users' Feedback For Out of Stock Message Manage ## ==

[iconMatrix](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/excellent-support-easy-to-use-6/): 
> 'Excellent Support & Easy to use

> I needed to get rid of the “Out of Stock” message and the “Sold Out” bubble completely and they helped me check the correct box to achieve what we needed for that single product. IMO if you are running a Woo system then you need this plugin. We sell tournaments and “Tournament is Closed” is better than “Out of Stock” 🙂

> I love this plugin,

[Ruben Zuidervaart](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/getting-rid-of-out-of-stock-message/): 
> 'Getting Rid Of “OUT OF STOCK” Message'

> After completing the build on my site for a digital product I disliked it saying out of stock because the product never is. This plugin was easy to use to remove that wording completely or replace it with something more appropriate.
> It works as advertised and was quite easy. Keep up the good work.
